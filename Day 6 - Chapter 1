Day6 - Chapter 1
1) Defining and calling Python Functions
=> A function is a named block of code that you can reuse by calling it.​
=> It’s like defining your own command.
=> Defining a function = telling Python what it does.
=> Calling a function = telling Python to actually do it now.

Example:- 
def greet():
    print("Hello, Azuma")
    print("Welcome back to Python.")

greet()
greet()
