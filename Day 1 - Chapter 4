4) Variables
=> Variables are like containers that hold the data (Values) in your program. 
=> You assign a value to a variable using the equal sign "=".
=> You can store different types of data.
=> You can then use the variable names to refer to the stored values anywhere in your code

Example:- 
name = "Spartan"
age = 21
