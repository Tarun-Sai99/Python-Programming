5) f - strings
=> f-strings are a clean way to put variables and expressions directly inside a string using {} with an f in front of the string.

Example: - 
i.
name = "Azuma"
age = 21
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

ii.
score = 45
print(f"Your score is {score} out of {50}")
print(f"Next year you will be {age + 1} years old.")
