Day 5 - Chapter 1
1) Loops
=> Loops let Python repeat code automatically instead of you writing the same line many times.
=> You will mainly use the for loop and the while loop.
For loop:- repeat for each item in a sequence (like a list, string, or range).

Example for For Loop:- 
i.
for num in range(1, 6):
    print(num)
ii.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
