Day 4 - Chapter 2
3) Lists
=> Lists in Python are ordered collections of items (values) that you can store in a single variable and change later. They are one of the most important data structures for Python and data science.
Example:-
states_of_usa = ["California", "Texas", "Florida"]
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
mixed = ["Azuma", 21, 5.9, True]
print(states_of_usa[0])
print(states_of_usa[1])
=> We can change and use the lists. 
states_of_usa[1] = "New Texas"      # modify
states_of_usa.append("New York")    # add at end
print(len(states_of_usa))           # length of the list
